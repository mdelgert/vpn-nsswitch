# vpn-nsswitch

A lightweight Debian package for Ubuntu that automates `/etc/nsswitch.conf` modifications to fix SSH DNS resolution issues for `.local` hostnames when using OpenVPN or WireGuard VPNs managed by NetworkManager.

When a VPN is activated, it sets:

```
hosts: files dns mdns4
```

to prioritize DNS resolution, ensuring SSH can resolve `.local` hostnames (e.g., `b1.local`). When the VPN is deactivated, it restores:

```
hosts: files mdns4_minimal [NOTFOUND=return] dns
```

to maintain default mDNS behavior.

## Features

- Supports OpenVPN and WireGuard VPNs with NetworkManager
- Automatically modifies `/etc/nsswitch.conf` when VPN connects/disconnects
- Preserves system integrity with backups and logging (`/var/log/nsswitch_script.log`)
- Easy installation via `.deb` package
- Compatible with Ubuntu 24.04 (other versions may work but are untested)

---

## Installation

### Download and Install

Download the latest `.deb` package from the [Releases page](https://github.com/mdelgert/vpn-nsswitch/releases).

Install using `apt`:

```sh
wget https://github.com/mdelgert/vpn-nsswitch/releases/download/v1.0.0/nsswitch-vpn_1.0.0_all.deb
sudo apt install ./nsswitch-vpn_1.0.0_all.deb
```

Or with `dpkg`:

```sh
sudo dpkg -i nsswitch-vpn_1.0.0_all.deb
sudo apt-get install -f
```

---

## Verify Installation

Check installed package:

```sh
dpkg -l nsswitch-vpn
```

Confirm scripts and configs:

```sh
ls /usr/local/bin/nsswitch_*.sh
ls /etc/nsswitch.d/*.conf
ls /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/99-vpn-nsswitch.sh
```

---

## Usage

### Ensure VPN Configuration

- Your VPN must be named `WireGuard` (for WireGuard) or `OpenVPN` (for OpenVPN) in NetworkManager.
- Interface must be `wg0` (WireGuard) or `tun0` (OpenVPN).

Verify:

```sh
nmcli connection show
```

---

### Activate VPN

```sh
nmcli connection up WireGuard  # Or OpenVPN
```

Or use the Network Settings GUI.

Check `nsswitch.conf`:

```sh
cat /etc/nsswitch.conf
```

Should show:

```
hosts: files dns mdns4
```

---

### Test SSH

```sh
ssh b1.local
```

---

### Deactivate VPN

```sh
nmcli connection down WireGuard  # Or OpenVPN
```

Check:

```sh
cat /etc/nsswitch.conf
```

Should show:

```
hosts: files mdns4_minimal [NOTFOUND=return] dns
```

---

### View Logs

```sh
cat /var/log/nsswitch_script.log
```

---

## Requirements

- **OS:** Ubuntu 24.04 (other versions may work but are untested)
- **Dependencies:** `network-manager`, `wireguard` (for WireGuard), `openvpn` (for OpenVPN), `bash`
- **VPN:** NetworkManager-managed VPN named `WireGuard` or `OpenVPN` with interface `wg0` or `tun0`
- **Permissions:** Root access for installation and script execution

---

## Troubleshooting

### SSH Still Fails

- Verify `/etc/nsswitch.conf` after VPN activation.
- Check logs:

  ```sh
  cat /var/log/nsswitch_script.log
  ```
- Ensure `~/.ssh/config` doesnâ€™t override `b1.local`:

  ```sh
  cat ~/.ssh/config
  ```

**Fix:**

```sshconfig
Host b1.local
    HostName 192.168.50.241
    User <username>
```

---

### mDNS Devices (e.g., printers) Fail

The `hosts: files dns mdns4` setting may delay mDNS resolution.

Test:

```sh
ping printer.local
avahi-browse -a
```

**Alternative:** Edit `/etc/nsswitch.d/nsswitch_up.conf`:

```
hosts: files mdns4_minimal dns
```

Re-run:

```sh
sudo /usr/local/bin/nsswitch_up.sh
```

---

### Dispatcher Not Triggering

Check NetworkManager dispatcher:

```sh
systemctl status NetworkManager-dispatcher.service
```

Restart:

```sh
sudo systemctl restart NetworkManager-dispatcher.service
```

Verify VPN name and interface:

```sh
nmcli connection show WireGuard
```

---

## Uninstallation

Remove the package:

```sh
sudo apt remove nsswitch-vpn
```

This runs `/usr/local/bin/nsswitch_down.sh` to restore `/etc/nsswitch.conf`.
