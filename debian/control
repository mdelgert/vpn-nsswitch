Description: Automates NSSwitch changes for VPN SSH DNS resolution
 Installs scripts to modify /etc/nsswitch.conf when OpenVPN (tun0) or WireGuard
 (wg0) VPNs managed by NetworkManager are activated or deactivated. Fixes SSH DNS
 resolution for .local hostnames by switching between 'hosts: files dns mdns4'
 and 'hosts: files mdns4_minimal [NOTFOUND=return] dns'. Includes logging and
 backups for safe operation.
